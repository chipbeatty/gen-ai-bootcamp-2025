        - BAD: In the vocab table, cells were blank for Japanses category
        - BAD: The beginner sentence is unncessary, should just start showing vocabulary table
        - BAD: In the clues we should not provide the polite form of verbs because the
        student needs to figure that out
        - BAD: The sentence structure says too much. We want something that is more conceptual 
        like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]

        I'll help you construct this sentence in Japanese! Let's break it down and work through it together.

        Here's the vocabulary you'll need:

        | Japanese | Romanji | English |
        |----------|---------|----------|
        | クマ      | kuma    | bear |
        | ドア      | doa     | door |
        | ゴミ      | gomi    | garbage |
        | いる      | iru     | to exist/be (for living things) |
        | 出す      | dasu    | to put out/take out |

        Possible sentence structure:
        1. First sentence: [Location] + [Subject] + [exists]
        2. Second sentence: [Object] + [verb]?

        Clues:
        1. For the first part, think about where the bears are. You'll need a location particle to mark where they are.
        2. For the second part, you're asking about a past action, so you'll need to conjugate the verb appropriately.
        3. Since this is a question, don't forget the question particle at the end.
